# Kansas City COVID-19 Comeback Plan

## Test. Track. Triumph.

There is a safe, scientifically-based way for the Kansas City region to come back from COVID-19 and keep it contained until there is a vaccine or cure. The plan involves ramping up **public testing**, building regional **contact tracing** capacity, and providing resources for **supported isolation** to make sure that everyone who is sick can self-isolate and everyone who is exposed can quarantine. It's imperative that we take a regional approach to implementing this plan, because the virus doesn't recognize state, county, and city boundaries.

**The Background:** The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed U.S. communities. For regions like the Greater Kansas City metro area – home to many subdivided locales and private health systems – there is a powerful need for a unified authority and response to the pandemic. The Comeback KC plan provides the structure necessary to contain COVID-19 in our region and allow for the strategic, sustainable reopening of our economy.

### Test • Track • Contain Strategy

Comeback KC’s plan takes lessons from national and global scientific authorities. To reach our goal of 10% testing and decline of new cases, Comeback KC advocates for the following approach:

**1. Large-scale Testing:** Countries that have curbed the coronavirus have conducted widespread testing and contact tracing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people. The Kansas City metro area must scale testing infrastructure capable of doing that allows for 150 tests per 100K people per day. That equates to about 2,800 tests per day for the region. Success requires coordination of public and private organizations, including usage of nontraditional partners and furloughed medical and civic professionals. We also recommend the adoption of a shared, region-wide symptom reporting tool to provide health departments with reliable, consistent data collection.

**2. Contact Tracing:** Contact tracing allows public health officials to understand the spread of the virus and lock down areas that are heavily affected. We must use existing and new phone bank assets for manual contact tracing, and recommend that people use the **[Safe Paths](https://covidsafepaths.org/)** digital contact tracing app for opt-in tracing and notification.

**3. Containment:** People who are sick with COVID-19 must self-isolate for at least 14 days, and people who have been exposed must quarantine for 14 days. In order to make this part of the plan viable, we strongly recommend that city and county governments implement supported isolation policies, so that everyone who needs to quarantine or self-isolate has the resources to do so. Local health departments are providing food, medical and other support to qualified people in self-isolation. Call 2-1-1 for info.

**4.** **Public Messaging:** Each element of this strategy requires public understanding, active participation, and compliance. We need to foster new social behaviors and norms for the duration of the pandemic. Regionally, this can best be accomplished with a unified campaign and message. Pooling resources in this way helps maximize the impact of every dollar spent on communications. Comeback KC has begun a public communications campaign to build awareness of the Test • Track • Contain strategy and to promote safer public behaviors, such as wearing a mask, washing hands often, and staying home as much as possible.

**About Comeback KC**

Comeback KC is a public/private partnership seeking to craft a unified strategy for how the entire Kansas City region can sustainably return from COVID-19. We are working across regional divisions to ensure that all of our populations come back in a better position than they were before this crisis. Our goal is to assist healthcare officials, public health departments, and public officials in their efforts to allocate resources effectively and efficiently in three areas: testing, contact tracing, and PPE. Together, we will become a model for regional cooperation and collective impact.
