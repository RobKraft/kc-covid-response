#SafeReturnKC. A guide for responsible re-entry to the workplace. As the Greater Kansas City business community adjusts day-to-day operations in response to COVID-19, we must balance the need to maintain our region’s economy with the protection of our community’s health. The Safe Return KC Guide provides a roadmap for organizations of all types across the region to use as we re-open our workplaces while considering the public health needs of our workforce, stakeholders, customers and community.
