To help spread the word about [Comeback KC](https://www.comebackkc.com/) and to encourage everyone to wear a face mask when out in public, we're hosting a virtual mask party on Instagram.

We've created an Instagram effect that lets you don a virtual mask in your favorite team colors or in support of your favorite KC area. We're asking everyone to try it out and post a photo or video to your Instagram feed and story **this Friday, May 15th.**

To try out the filter, follow [this link](https://bit.ly/2yN62Q0) on your smartphone. Or check out [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJmV6P0YI-CE1_xSGbEtYQa1h1-l2Xi66EdsPhsNEeE/edit?usp=sharing) if you're new to Instagrameffects. You can also find a link to the effect on our Instagram bio,[@comeback_kc](https://www.instagram.com/comeback_kc/).
