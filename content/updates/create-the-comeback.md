For Kansas City to make a healthy, safe comeback from COVID-19, it will take all of us working together. That's why Comeback KC is making our creative kit available for free reuse. Kansas City is a city of makers and creators, and we want to encourage our creative community to use, create and share their own creations with our campaign. And yes, commercial reuse is allowed and encouraged. The only thing we forbid is using our creative assets to spread disinformation or anything deemed contrary to the interests of public health (as determined by our local public health agencies). Otherwise, go wild with it. We'd love to see what you create, so tag us on social media or shoot us a note.
