question: What is Comeback KC?
---
Comeback KC is a private/public collaboration to create a unified strategy and message to help the entire Kansas City region make a comeback from COVID-19. We are working across our city's dividing lines to create a unified comeback. We're not content with going back to normal, we are determined to come back better than before. We are coordinating with public health departments in the metro to build testing and contact tracing capacity so that we can safely reopen our city and our economy.
